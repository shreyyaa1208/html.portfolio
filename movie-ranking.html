<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>the Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that
    foundation is hope.
</p>
<h3>External Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Michel Gondry's "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a bizarre but wonderful movie, a very strange and
    remarkably tender experience, which I suppose is only to be expected from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the man
    behind "Being John Malkovich."

<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
